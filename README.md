# Recon-Workflow-Documentation
Welcome to my first project out of school! This document outlines a detailed Reconnaissance Workflow using industry-standard tools and techniques. The goal is to provide clear, actionable steps for identifying domains, subdomains, services, vulnerabilities, and sensitive information during reconnaissance.

As this is my first professional-level documentation, I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or recommendations for improvement. Your insights will help me refine my approach and grow as a cybersecurity professional.

To create this workflow, I utilized a combination of YouTube tutorials, AI tools, and various learning materials. These resources helped me understand and structure the content effectively. I hope this effort reflects the knowledge I've gained and provides value to others starting their cybersecurity journey.
